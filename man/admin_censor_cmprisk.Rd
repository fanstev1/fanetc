\usage{
admin_censor_cmprisk(df, evt_time, evt, adm_cnr_time = NULL,
  evt_label = NULL, overwrite_var = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{input data}

\item{evt_time}{a numeric vector recording the time points at which the event occurs.}

\item{evt}{an integer vector indicating right censoring (0= censored; 1= event of interest; other= competing risk(s)).}

\item{adm_cnr_time}{a numeric vector specifying the time point at which administrative censoring is applied.}

\item{evt_label}{a numeric vector specifying the time point at which administrative censoring is applied.}

\item{overwrite_var}{a logical scalar (default= FALSE) indiciates if the existing time-to-event variables should be overwritten.}
}
\value{
The input data plus censored time-to-event variables.
}
\description{
admin_censor_cmprisk
}
\details{
The function creates time-to-event variables with the application of administrative censoring for a competing risk
analysis. The newly created variables are named by the same variables names but with a suffix of '_adm' by default.
The original variables can be overwritten by specifying overwrite_var= TRUE. Overwriting the original variables is
not recommended, but it can be useful in some situation.
